# ALBERT-LM

1. Custom Model: Creates an AlbertWithLMHead class that adds a language modeling head on top of the pretrained ALBERT model.

2. Dataset: Implements a custom dataset class that contains input-output pairs for training. I've included several similar examples to improve training.

3. Training Loop: Sets up the training procedure with appropriate loss function, optimizer, and learning rate scheduler.

4. Response Generation: Implements a function to generate responses using the fine-tuned model.
